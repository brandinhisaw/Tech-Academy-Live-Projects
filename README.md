## [Unity Live Project - PuttPutt Mini-Golf](https://github.com/brandinhisaw/Tech-Academy-Live-Projects/tree/main/Unity%20Live%20Project)
The Tech Academy runs a Live Project for two weeks where I worked with a team of my peers to develop a PuttPutt mini-golf game using Unity and C#. I worked on several stories to improve both the design and functionality of a new course, Hole03. This involved crafting a new course and modeling the environment with scenery, lighting, and particle effects. Systems were implemented to handle audio and scene management in a scalable way.
