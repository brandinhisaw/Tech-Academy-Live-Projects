# Unity Live Project

## Introduction
The Tech Academy runs a Live Project for two weeks where I worked with a team of my peers to develop a PuttPutt mini-golf game using Unity and C#. I worked on several stories to improve both the design and functionality of a new course, Hole03. This involved crafting a new course and modeling the environment with scenery, lighting, and particle effects. Systems were implemented to handle audio and scene management in a scalable way.

## Design Stories
The new level, Hole03, was provided with a very simple course consisting of only a start and end. I was then given a story to create my own level with provided models and materials and then decorate the background scene. Additionally, I was given stories to a create lighting effects (lanterns on the ground, fire light) as well as particle effects (fire and smoke, mist from the river rocks).
